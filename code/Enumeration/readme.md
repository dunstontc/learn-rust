# [Enums and Pattern Matching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch06-00-enums.html)

Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible values.

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

OR...

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

Better yet...

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

> Enums are for ballers, and can have methods defined on them.

```rust
// struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
// struct MoveMessage {
//     x: i32,
//     y: i32,
// }
// struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
// struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct

enum Message {
    Quit,                       // has no data associated with it at all
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },    // includes an anonymous struct inside it
    Write(String),              // includes a single String
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32), // includes three i32 values
}

impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // method body would be defined here
    }
}
```


## ~~Null~~ Optional

In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:
> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

## Matching with `Option<T>`
