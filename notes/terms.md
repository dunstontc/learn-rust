## Terms
- Memory
  - **stack**
    - LIFO, speedy, quality Memory storage.
  - **heap**
    - Unordered, general, bulk Memory storage.
  - **data race**
    - A *data race* is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:
      - 1. Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
      - 2. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
      - 3. There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.
  - **reference**
  - **deref coercion**
  - **unwinding**
- Functions
  - **statement**
    - *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
  - **expression**
    - *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value.
  - **associated function**
    - Static Method
- OOP
  - **bounded parametric polymorphism**
  - **generics**
  - **trait**
    - A *trait* tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and can share with other types.
    - *Traits* are similar to a feature often called *interfaces* in other languages, although with some differences.
    - **Derivable Traits**
- Matches
  - **arm**
    - An *arm* consists of a pattern and the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the *match* expression fits that arm’s pattern.
  - **match guard**
    - an extra condition on a match arm that further refines the arm’s pattern
    - ex: `if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound`
- Misc
  - **borrowing**
    - We call having references as function parameters borrowing. 
    - As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back.
  - **lifetime**
  - **shadowing**
    - This feature is often used in similar situations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another type.
  - **tuple**
    - A *tuple* is a general way of grouping together some number of other values with a variety of types into one compound type.
  - **tuple struct**
  - [**hashing function**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch08-03-hash-maps.html#hashing-functions)
  - **Monomorphization**
    - *Monomorphization* is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled. 
    - Rust uses *monomorphization* to implement *generics* in such a way that your code doesn’t run any slower using generic types than it would with concrete types.
