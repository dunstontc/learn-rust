## Terms
- The Stack & the heap
  - **stack**
    - LIFO, speedy, quality Memory storage.
  - **heap**
    - Unordered, general, bulk Memory storage.
- **arm**
  - An *arm* consists of a pattern and the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the *match* expression fits that arm’s pattern.
- **associated function**
  - Static Method
- **borrowing**
  - We call having references as function parameters borrowing. 
  - As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back.
- **shadowing**
  - This feature is often used in similar situations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another type.
- **statement**
  - *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- **expression**
  - *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value.
- **tuple**
  - A *tuple* is a general way of grouping together some number of other values with a variety of types into one compound type.
- **tuple struct**
- **generic**
- **trait**
  - **Derivable Traits**
- **lifetime**
- **data race**
  - A *data race* is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:
    - 1. Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
    - 2. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
    - 3. There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.
- OOP
  **bounded parametric polymorphism**
